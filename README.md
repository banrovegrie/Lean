## About
This contains my implementations for the UPenn course on Software Foundations and further attempts at working with Coq.

- I use resources from all over the place and I am really sorry that I am unable to provide a reference for all of them.
- I shall also try to understand how Coq works especially it's compilations.
- Maybe look into Type Theory through Coq.
